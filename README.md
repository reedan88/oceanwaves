# oceanwaves

```oceanwaves``` is a package to calculate the wave spectra and summary statistics for surface wave based on measurements from the SeaBird SBE26 pressure sensor operating in waveburst mode. 


This package is based on the R-language package ```oceanwaves```, developed by Luke Miller, to derive ocean wave height statistics from Ocean Wave Height Loggers, modified for the SeaBird SBE26 Wave Burst measurements following the Sea-Bird SBE26 User's Manual. The algorithms are adapted from the
